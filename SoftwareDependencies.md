# Software Dependencies #

  * [Triangular Mesh](http://www.skyserver.org/htm/Old_default.aspx) : A Java implementation of the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (HTM), a partitioning scheme to divide the surface of the Earth's sphere into spherical triangles.
  * [SqliteJDBC](http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/) : A Java JDBC driver for SQLite.
  * [Colt](http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt/) : A set of Open Source Libraries for High Performance Scientific and Technical Computing in Java.
  * [WebGraph](http://webgraph.dsi.unimi.it/) : A Java framework to study graphs, providing simple ways to manage very large graphs, exploiting modern compression techniques.
  * [Computing PageRank and its Derivatives](http://law.di.unimi.it/software/download/) : A Java library that builds on WebGraph to compute the PageRank algorithm.
  * [Weighted graphs](http://law.di.unimi.it/satellite-software/weighted/) : A Java package that builds on WebGraph and implements a simple arc-weighted graph in which each arc has a weight expressed as a float. The package also contains a class for computing a PageRank scoring that is sensitive to these weights.
  * [Approximate Triangle Counting](http://law.di.unimi.it/satellite-software/weighted/) : A up tools for library that builds on WebGraph and implements methods for exact and approximate triangle counting in large graphs.
  * [Triangular random walks](http://law.di.unimi.it/satellite-software/triangrw/) : A Java package that builds on WebGraph and implements triangular random walks.
